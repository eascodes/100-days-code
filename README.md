# 100 Days of Code

I have committed to completing #100DaysofCode, starting October 26, 2021.

Through this challenge, I will code for at least 1 hour per day. I will share my progress through this log, as well as my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/eascodes). Thanks to [Alex Kallaway](https://twitter.com/ka11away) for creating the challenge.
