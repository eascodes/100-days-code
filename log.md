# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed basic HTML, basic CSS, and applied visual design modules on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed the HTML module, which was a refresher from previous courses I completed on CodeAcademy. I enjoyed the CSS module as well but toward the end it took me longer to grasp the concepts.

### Day 9: November 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I spent most of my time today working on the CSS for my project #3 landing page. I am satisfied with how the landing page looks, but need to a little more work on the media queries.

**Thoughts** This was by far my favorite project so far. I have thought about selling my own homemade soap, so making a landing page for my own potential project made it really fun. I did a lot of problem-solving to reach the aesthetic I desired for the page, such as importing assets from Figma.

### Day 10: November 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I started and completed project #3 for my FreeCodeCamp course, which was a technical document about scalable vector graphics.

**Thoughts** This was the most content-heavy project that I've done so far, which made HTML organization extremely important. I felt much more comfortable with my HTML and CSS coding, and enjoyed styling the document at the end. The largest challenge was deciding how to organize the info on the page - initially I tried using flexbox to manipulate the elements but realized it wasn't the best application for this project. One thing I learned was how to use <code></code> to show code examples on my webpage.

### Day 11: November 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the HTML and CSS for my professional portfolio website.

**Thoughts** I started creating a portfolio website when I began my HTML & CSS tutorials, but today I decided to update it with a new layout. I found it challenging to re-arrange what I had created, so I ended up starting over and re-inserting code section by section. This was immensely helpful, as I was able to see how every line of code impacted the page and also make my coding a little cleaner.

**Link(s) to work** https://www.freecodecamp.org/eascodes

## Day 67: January 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I set up the front page of my recipe website to pull & display recipes from my database once they submitted through the "new recipe" form. I also set up a functional search bar.

**Thoughts** I am ecstatic that I was able to figure these tasks out! I used the same series of PHP tutorials as before, but had to tailor the instructions more for what I was trying to accomplish. I ran into a few errors and issues along the way but was able to quickly figure them out.

**Link(s) to work** https://emily.schtubbs.com/recipe/index.php

## Day 68: January 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on re-organizing my folders & files in Visual Studio Code. I started running into issues with having git repos within git repos.

## Day 74: January 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the search bar functionality for the meal prep recipe website. I figured out how to successfully search for recipe names and recipes tags.

**Thoughts** I thought it was interesting that one of the tutorial challenges I completed yesterday helped me to solve an issue I was having with my coding today.

## Day 75: January 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the search bar functionality for the meal prep recipe website. I figured out how to successfully show recipe names as the search results for recipe names, recipes tags, and usernames.

**Thoughts** I was excited to get the recipe names to show up as the search results! The search bar is now functional for searching each type of element (#tag, @user, or recipe name) individually, but now I need to figure out how to narrow search results when a search string contains multiple types of elements.

## Day 76: January 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the search bar functionality for the meal prep recipe website. I figured out how to successfully search the database using combined search terms, thus narrowing the results. There is one issue that I am still having when >2 types of search elements are used, but I believe I'm on the right track for the solution.

**Thoughts** I was REALLY excited to get the search bar working for multiple types of search terms. This is something that I initially thought would be much too complicated for me to figure out, but here I am!

## Day 77: January 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working on the Functional Programming module on the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** Today I was reflecting on how confusing "for loops" were when I first learned about them, and now I can knock them out without thinking twice. Sometimes progress seems slow, but when I look at the larger picture, I am impressed by how much I've accomplished in the past 2.5 months. I have said this before, but I will continue to say, that a huge catalyst to my learning is working on real life projects in tandem with structured training/tutorials.

## Day 78: January 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the search bar functionality for the meal prep recipe website. I learned some new PHP functions such as "call_user_func_array()" and "array_values()". I have the search bar almost completely finished except for one of my test searches - the results aren't showing correctly.

**Thoughts** I think I am going to write out some of my code on paper to try to figure out what is happening with the search bar issue. I am excited that it's almost complete.

## Day 79: January 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the search bar functionality for the meal prep recipe website. I pinpointed the issue I've been facing - there is an unecessary loop happening with one of my array_push functions. Now that I know where the problem is, I'm working through ways to fix it.

**Thoughts** I feel much better now that I understand where the problem is. What helped me discover this was printing my variables one by one to see where the issue started.

## Day 80: January 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished working on the search bar functionality for the meal prep recipe website. Users can now search combinations of recipe names, usernames, and recipes tags and the search function will narrow results appropriately. The issue I was facing yesterday was solved by moving the location of one of my variables which set up an empty array. After finishing the search bar, I continued working on the functional programming module on the JavaScript FreeCodeCamp course.

**Thoughts** I am so excited that I finished the search bar! I honestly thought it would be too complicated for me to figure out with my level of experience. Working on the search bar complemented my JavaScript learning as well.

## Day 82: January 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the intermediate algorithm scripting module for the JavaScript FreeCodeCamp course.

**Thoughts** These challenges are taking me quite a while to solve but I am enjoying them. I am finding it helpful to alternate between coding for 45 mins straight and taking 15 minute breaks.
