# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed basic HTML, basic CSS, and applied visual design modules on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed the HTML module, which was a refresher from previous courses I completed on CodeAcademy. I enjoyed the CSS module as well but toward the end it took me longer to grasp the concepts.

### Day 2: October 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed applied accessibility and responsive web design principles modules on FreeCodeCamp. Started working on a professional portfolio website to apply the concepts.

**Thoughts**: The applied accessibility module was very interesting because it helped to put a lot of the HTML structure concepts into context. I really enjoyed starting my own project, though I did get stuck on some of the design work for the front page.

### Day 3: October 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Flexbox module on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Very useful info for page design, but it felt like a lot to wrap my head around at once. Will be very helpful to apply in practice.

### Day 4: October 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Grid module on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Similar thoughts as yesterday - good info but hard to comprehend in tutorials. Looking forward to starting some of the module projects.

### Day 5: October 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started project #1 for the Responsive Web Design certification on FreeCodeCamp. I learned how to use CodePen and set up a tribute webpage for Emma Gatewood. I worked mainly on the HTML coding for the page.

**Thoughts** I was intimidated at first when I was trying to figure out how to run code tests on CodePen, but once I figured it out, it felt really great to get started with setting the page up. I liked seeing all of the results of my coding instantly.

### Day 6: October 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I completed my tribute webpage for project #1, spent most of today working on the CSS coding.

**Thoughts** It was fun to look at the example CSS code and see how each element related to the final look of the page. I enjoyed creating my own "style" for the page.

### Day 7: November 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I started and completed project #2 for the Responsive Web Design certification on FreeCodeCamp. I created a bakery order form on CodePen.

**Thoughts** I loved creating this project, and got to practice coding various types of survey form inputs. I spent a while working on the background image for the webpage, as I could not get it to show up, but eventually figured it out!

### Day 8: November 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I completed the project #3 HTML coding for the Responsive Web Design certification on FreeCodeCamp. I am creating a product landing page for a cold process soap company.

**Thoughts** Compared to the last 2 projects, I enjoyed deviating more from the project example code as I set up the webpage. I look forward to digging into the CSS tomorrow.

### Day 9: November 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I spent most of my time today working on the CSS for my project #3 landing page. I am satisfied with how the landing page looks, but need to a little more work on the media queries.

**Thoughts** This was by far my favorite project so far. I have thought about selling my own homemade soap, so making a landing page for my own potential project made it really fun. I did a lot of problem-solving to reach the aesthetic I desired for the page, such as importing assets from Figma.

### Day 10: November 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I started and completed project #3 for my FreeCodeCamp course, which was a technical document about scalable vector graphics.

**Thoughts** This was the most content-heavy project that I've done so far, which made HTML organization extremely important. I felt much more comfortable with my HTML and CSS coding, and enjoyed styling the document at the end. The largest challenge was deciding how to organize the info on the page - initially I tried using flexbox to manipulate the elements but realized it wasn't the best application for this project. One thing I learned was how to use <code></code> to show code examples on my webpage.

### Day 11: November 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the HTML and CSS for my professional portfolio website.

**Thoughts** I started creating a portfolio website when I began my HTML & CSS tutorials, but today I decided to update it with a new layout. I found it challenging to re-arrange what I had created, so I ended up starting over and re-inserting code section by section. This was immensely helpful, as I was able to see how every line of code impacted the page and also make my coding a little cleaner.

### Day 12: November 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued to work on my professional portfolio website. I created links to the projects I've accomplished so far, and learned how to create social media links. 

**Thoughts** I am happy with how the portfolio is shaping up. I am learning that less is sometimes more. I just need to add some finishing touches and then I'll be starting on some new projects to add to the portfolio.

### Day 13: November 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished my portfolio webpage. I focused most of my time on media queries. 

**Thoughts** Making the webpage responsive to various browser sizes was challenging, but a great learning lesson for keeping responsivity in mind from the very start of a project.

### Day 14: November 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I received my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certificate. I completed final touches on my projects, and learned about how I can use the Inspect browser feature to take full size screenshots and see the browser heights/widths in pixels. I also learned how to set up my GitHub repos on my server, GitHub, & in my local environment, so I can use a local server to do web development.

**Thoughts** My progress with setting up my coding environment today will allow me to code more easily/efficiently.

### Day 15: November 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the Basic JavaScript course on FreeCodeCamp.

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued the Basic JavaScript course on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I intended to finish this module today but ended up getting stuck and spent >2 hours on one of the questions involving accessing nested arrays. After spending a while on it, I ended up talking the problem through with someone and starting my code over from the beginning. That was the trick! It was fun to problem-solve.

## Day 21: November 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I started on a new project. I am making a business website for the bakery that my mom is hoping to start next year. I created the HTML & CSS files for the website, and began setting up my HTML code structure.

**Thoughts** It feels nice to get back to HTML & CSS after working with JavaScript for a few days. I'm really excited about this project!

## Day 22: November 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I created the first drafts of the landing page and "About" page for the bakery website.

**Thoughts** My favorite part was doing the styling for my links/buttons (I love the :hover function). The most challenging part was aligning items with CSS flexbox. I found it extremely helpful to create colorful borders for all of the items/containers while working with them. Making my landing page responsive on several screen sizes/types was easier than I anticipated - hopefully the other website pages are the same!

**Today's Progress**: Today I created the contact page for my bakery website. I learned how to embed a Google map and created a contact form. I worked on making all of the pages responsive on various screen sizes.
